<h1>Principles</h1>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Keep it slocial</strong> — Take your time, quality over quantity</li>
  <li><strong>Privacy first</strong> — We don't want your data, just your ideas</li>
  <li><strong>Evergreen only</strong> — Not a place to get your news. Write what matters in a month, a year</li>
  <li><strong>Think generations</strong> — Leave a letter for your great great grandchildren</li>
  <li><strong>Be human</strong> — Thoughtful or funny, both welcome. Just be real</li>
  <li><strong>Patience</strong> — Good thoughts need time to steep</li>
  <li><strong>Clarity</strong> — Say what you mean, mean what you say</li>
  <li><strong>Kindness</strong> — Resonate with others, not against them</li>
  <li><strong>Build on ideas</strong> — Dialectic over debate. Ideas aren't just added but transformed through interaction. Help thoughts become what they're trying to be. Create cognitive scaffolding for others to reach new heights. The best conversations generate something neither person could have conceived alone</li>
  <li><strong>Hold the tension</strong> — Some truths exist in paradox. Resist the urge to resolve contradictions too quickly. The space between opposing ideas is often where insight lives</li>
  <li><strong>Intention</strong> — One letter a day keeps the noise away</li>
  <li><strong>Simplicity</strong> — No algorithms, no metrics, just words</li>
</ul>
