    <h2>The Mosaic Mind</h2>
    <p>
      Slocial is not a website but a <em>web sight</em> — a place where patterns emerge from fragments, 
      where meaning assembles itself like a mosaic rather than flowing like a stream. 
      In the spirit of Marshall McLuhan, we've built a cool medium that demands your participation, 
      your pattern recognition, your ability to see the whole through its parts.
    </p>
    
    <div class="mosaic-visual">

    <p>
      Each letter is a tessera in a larger mosaic. Each mosaic reveals patterns that linear thinking cannot capture. 
      This is acoustic space, not visual space — simultaneous, not sequential.

    <h2>The 12-Hour Steep</h2>
    
    <div class="quote-block">
      "We shape our tools and thereafter they shape us."
      <cite>— Marshall McLuhan</cite>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Every letter waits 12 hours before appearing — not as a limitation, but as a feature. 
      This delay transforms the medium itself. In a world of hot takes, we offer cool contemplation. 
      The pause changes not just what we write, but how we think about writing.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Time becomes part of the message. The delay is the design. The waiting is the writing.
    </p>

  <div class="about-section">
    <h2>Mosaics, Not Categories</h2>
    <p>
      We don't have tags or categories — we have mosaics. Each mosaic is a pattern of meaning 
      curated by passionate editors who see connections where algorithms see only keywords. 
      These are not filing systems but constellations of thought, each piece illuminating the others.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In the electric age, we wear all mankind as our skin. Our mosaics are the patterns 
      that help us feel the texture of that collective wisdom.

    <h2>The Observer Completes the Circuit</h2>
    
    <div class="quote-block">
      "The viewer is the content. In low definition media, the audience is deeply involved 
      and must participate to complete the experience."
      <cite>— Marshall McLuhan</cite>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Every expression of an idea remains incomplete until met by an observer. The writer 
      releases fragments into the world; the reader assembles meaning. This is not a bug 
      in human communication — it is the feature that makes understanding possible.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Our letters are deliberately low-fidelity. Plain text. Minimal formatting. No embedded 
      media. This isn't technological limitation but philosophical intention. Like television 
      in McLuhan's analysis, or pointillist painting, our mosaics provide just enough 
      resolution to suggest form while demanding the reader's participation to complete it.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      High-fidelity media — the 4K video, the perfectly produced podcast, the photo-realistic 
      rendering — these are "hot" media in McLuhan's terminology. They extend a single sense 
      in high definition, leaving little for the audience to fill in. They wash over you. 
      They are complete.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      But low-fidelity media — the telephone call, the cartoon, the haiku, and yes, the 
      text-based letter — these are "cool." They provide incomplete information, creating 
      gaps that pull the audience in. The reader doesn't just receive; they reconstruct. 
      They don't just consume; they complete.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In our mosaics, each letter is a single tile — low resolution on its own, gaining 
      definition only through proximity to others and through the pattern-recognition of 
      an engaged mind. The fidelity isn't in the individual pieces but in the intervals 
      between them, the resonances across them, the ghost of wholeness that emerges when 
      an active observer engages with the incomplete.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This is why we limit formatting, why we eschew images, why we slow down publication. 
      We're not building a gallery for passive viewing but a workshop for active construction. 
      Every reader rebuilds every letter through their own perceptual apparatus, their own 
      memories, their own patterns of meaning.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The author proposes; the reader disposes. The writer fragments; the reader recomposes. 
      In this dance of incompletion and participation, meaning doesn't transmit — it emerges.

    <h2>The Medium's Massage</h2>
    <p>
      Slocial massages your mind into new patterns. The enforced slowness, the mosaic organization, 
      the absence of algorithmic curation — these aren't features of the platform, they <em>are</em> the platform. 
      The constraints are the content.
    </p>
    
    <div class="quote-block">
      "The medium is the message. This is merely to say that the personal and social consequences 
      of any medium result from the new scale that is introduced into our affairs."
      <cite>— Marshall McLuhan, Understanding Media</cite>
    </div>
    
    <p>
      Here, we're scaling down to scale up. Slowing down to speed up understanding. 
      Fragmenting to complete ideas. This is our paradox and our promise.

    <h2>Join the Mosaic</h2>
    <p>
      Slocial is a living experiment in what happens when we design technology that respects 
      the ecology of mind. When we treat words not as content to be consumed but as 
      environment to be inhabited.
