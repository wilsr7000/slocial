<h1>About Slocial</h1>
<p>Slocial is a slow social networkâ€”a place for thoughtful letters that steep before they publish.</p>
<p>We believe that good writing, like good tea, needs time to develop its full character. Every letter waits 12 hours before appearing, giving you space to reflect on what you've written.</p>
<p>One letter per day keeps the pace human. No infinite scroll, no algorithmic feeds, just considered thoughts shared at a natural rhythm.</p>
<p>Founded on the principle that the best conversations happen when we slow down.</p>
